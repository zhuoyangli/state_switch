# **State Switch**

## **Overview**
This is the repository for the deep sampling project with which we aim to characterize control processes underlying brain state switches during internally-driven thoughts.
We include a number of different behavioral tasks in the study:
- Passive story listening (stimuli obtained from the Moth podcast)
- Semantic verbal fluency (sVF)
- Scrabble task
- Goal-directed story improvision
- Free think aloud
